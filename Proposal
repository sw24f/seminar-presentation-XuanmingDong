# Simple chicken and rabbit in the same cage problem explores probability theory and statistical problems in ancient Chinese history

Explore the problem of chicken and rabbit in the same cage, and search for relevant actual cases and data, to briefly discuss different statistical problems and cases in Chinese history. I want to obtain statistical or probabilistic trends and historical reasons by analyzing these ancient and modern cases.

I think that collecting cases and data from history is a new and meaningful challenge. At the same time, I am also interested in understanding the statistical resonance brought by different cultures and regions. I think in the data processing, I will check what the variables and results are that may change the results in different cases.

Regarding the exploration and mastery of methods, I hope that I can explore the differences between different statistical cases by controlling variables in experiments, or by subjective observation of experimental objects, experimental cases, and observation cases, and summarize these differences to find a change order of historical development. By comparing with the historical background, we may have more meaningful discoveries. I may refer to all the documents or allusions recorded in ancient books to dialectically verify the possibility and connection related to statistics. I also want to tell the development trend and significance of statistics in ancient China and New China by comparing with different cases in ancient and modern times. This may need to be combined with historical background, etc.
