With the development of the times, many ideas about statistics have been born in the past 50 years. Among them, the author Andrew Gelman and the author Aki Vehtari mentioned 8 relatively important ideas. These statistical ideas are not ranked high or low, and there are some connections between them. The article uses examples to illustrate the development and derivation of these ideas in the past 50 years, as well as their adaptability and effectiveness in different environments. Through these concepts, the development trend of statistics in the future is briefly predicted. Through my presentation, I want to try my best to explain the definitions and show simple examples of 8 different statistical ideas to let readers understand how these 8 statistical ideas are applied to our daily lives.
